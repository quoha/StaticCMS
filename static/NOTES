*	Something
	*	Initializes the CGI
	*	All controllers register themselves
		*	/area/parameters/action
		*	Pattern matching
			/post/YYYY/MM => show posts for year/month with action SHOW
			/post/YYYY => show posts for year with action SHOW
			/post/TEXT => show posts for article with title TITLE, with action SHOW
			/post => show most recent post, with action SHOW
	*	Initializes the Stack
		*	Push parameters
	*	Calls the Router
		*	Determine controller
		*	Push action
		*	Call controller

*	The router
	*	Accepts the URI
	*	Extracts parameters from the URI
	*	Determines which controller to call
		*	Not very smart
		*	Passes URI (sans parameters) to each in turn
		*	First to return "sure" gets to handle the URI

*	The controller
	*	Accepts a URI request from the router
		*	If we can handle, return true
		*	If we can't, return false
	*	Accepts a URI to process from the router
	*	Determines which model to invoke
	*	Invokes the model
	*	Determines which view to invoke
	*	Invokes the view

*	The model
	*	Interacts directly with the database
	*	Logic is done by sub-classing NFTM::Model

*	The view takes data from the model
	*	Has a template
	*	Does not manipulate the stack directly
	*	Pushes text on to the stack
	*	Calls functions to operate on the stack

*	The stack
	*	Takes cells as items

*	A cell
	*	Can be a number
	*	Can be a stack
	*	Can be text
